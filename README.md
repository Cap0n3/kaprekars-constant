# Kaprekar's Constant Finder

This fun Python project calculates Kaprekar's constant for a given four-digit number. Kaprekar's constant, 6174, represents the fixed point that all four-digit numbers eventually reach when their digits are repeatedly rearranged and processed. This small program demonstrates this fascinating mathematical phenomenon through a simple command-line interface.
