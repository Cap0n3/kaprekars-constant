# Kaprekar Constant Finder

This command-line Python project calculates Kaprekar's constants for both three and four-digit numbers. Kaprekar's constants represent fascinating fixed points that numbers with specific digits reach when their digits are repeatedly rearranged and processed according to Kaprekar's routine.

- For four-digit numbers, the constant is famously 6174. This phenomenon, often referred to as Kaprekar's routine, ensures that nearly all four-digit numbers (except for multiples of 1111) will eventually transform into 6174 through a specific sequence of operations.
  
- For three-digit numbers, the constant is 495. Similarly, through Kaprekar's routine, most three-digit numbers will evolve into 495 following a specific sequence of digit manipulations.

## How to Use

Simply run the program from your command line and follow the prompts to enter a three or four-digit number. The program will then display each step of the process, ultimately showing how the number transforms into its respective Kaprekar's constant.

Enjoy !
